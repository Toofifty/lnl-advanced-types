# Lunch & Learn - Advanced TS Typing

## The goal

* Understand how to use TypeScript utility types
* Understand advanced type concepts

## The plan

* Explore TypeScript's utility types, and experiment with re-implementing them ourselves
* We'll cover:
    * Type parameters (AKA _Generics_)
        * Type parameter constraints
    * Conditional types
        * The _never_ type
        * Inference
    * Mapped types
        * Modifiers

We'll step through *6* utility types that display a wide range of advanced TypeScript concepts. In each, I'll explain and demonstrate the purpose of the type, and introduce the appropriate concepts to implement the type ourselves. Since this is all live-coding we'll have Intellisense via VSCode. You can follow along in your own editor if you wish - you can clone this repository from:
